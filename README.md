## Description
Movies have been a primary source of entertainment for everyone, most of the people go to the theatres regularly or binge watch them from their personal computers. People spend most amount of time searching for a good movie to watch. There is a huge amount of data in the form of reviews, comments, blogs etc., which help people to choose from. This project is based on recommender systems using machine learning algorithms mainly Multinomial Logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbours and Decision Tree Classifier. With the help of this project  users can search their desired genre movies and pick one with highest rating available. We have a dataset cantaining ratings, genres and titles of different movies, applying the said aalgorithms on this data gives the prediction of best movies in the given genre.
